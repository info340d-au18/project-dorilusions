            <h2> Topic Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Taiko Kai is the University of Washington's first Taiko ensemble, and was founded in 2013 by three sisters at UW. Taiko Kai's goal
                is to promote and spread appreciation Japanese culture through the art of traditional Japanese drumming by evoking a sense of heritage
                and social understanding.  Since Taiko's founding, Since then, Taiko Kai has performed at various campus events such as FIUTS's
                CulturalFest, New Student Orientation, and the TSA Night Market. They have also performed at noteworthy events in the Seattle area
                such as Redmond City Lights and Sakura-Con.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the club currently has no web functional web platform.  Currently, information about Taiko Kai is scattered across multiple 
                Facebook and campus centers. With a large portion of Taiko Kai's performance and equipment funding coming from performance 
                bookings/donations, it would be beneficial for Taiko Kai to have a hub for booking and information about the club.  Additionally, 
                Taiko Kai struggles to recruit new members each year, with most new members joining the club through on-campus promotions (RSO Fair)
                and word of mouth. As such, having a web application for potential members to express interest and discover the club would also be 
                helpful. Finally, all member-related documents and information are stored in Google Drive.  As such, we would like to create a
                webpage that would consolidate all current information.  The website would not only be a source for anyone intereted in discovering
                more about Taiko, but would also be a way for potential members and bookers to contact Taiko Kai directly.  In addition, the website
                would be a resource for current Taiko members as a central point of access for meeting notes, sheet music, and practice videos are
                currently stored in several Google Drives.
