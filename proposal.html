                <p class="w3-justify">
                    Taiko Kai is the University of Washington's first Taiko ensemble, and was founded in 2013 by three
                    sisters at UW. Taiko Kai's goal is to promote and spread appreciation Japanese culture through the art
                    of traditional Japanese drumming by evoking a sense of heritage and social understanding. The club also
                    fosters connections between its members and the Japanese-American community, helping them develop both
                    personal and team-based skills. Since Taiko's founding, Taiko Kai has performed at various campus
                    events such as FIUTS's CulturalFest, New Student Orientation, and the TSA Night Market. They have also
                    performed at noteworthy events in the Seattle area such as Redmond City Lights and Sakura-Con.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-justify">
                    However, the club currently has no web functional web platform. Information about Taiko Kai
                    is scattered across multiple Facebook and campus pages. With a large portion of Taiko Kai's
                    performance and equipment funding coming from performance bookings/donations, it would be beneficial
                    for Taiko Kai to have a hub for booking and information about the club. Additionally, Taiko Kai
                    struggles to recruit new members each year, with most new members joining the club through on-campus
                    promotions and word of mouth. Having a web application for potential members to
                    express interest and discover the club would also be helpful. Finally, all member-related documents
                    and information are stored in Google Drive. As such, we would like to create a webpage that would
                    consolidate all current information. The website would not only be a source for anyone interested in
                    discovering more about Taiko, but would also be a way for potential members and bookers to contact
                    Taiko Kai directly. In addition, the website would be a resource for current Taiko members as a central
                    point of access for meeting notes, sheet music, and practice videos which are currently stored in Google
                    Drive.

                <h2 class="w3-wide"> POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS </h2>
                <div>
                    <h4>Event Management</h4>
                    <p class="w3-justify w3-margin-bottom">
                        One application of our website would be to simplify processes surrounding events and performances.
                        This includes functions such as booking performances, looking up upcoming events, and getting
                        connected with the club. UW Taiko Kai performs for both student as well as outside organizations.
                        As such, we want to make sure that everyone has easy access and will be able to quickly conatct
                        Taiko Kai. One function of our application would include a form that users would be able to quickly
                        fill out with their organization information and potential performance dates/locations to book
                        Taiko Kai for performances. Right now, the sole way to book Taiko Kai would be to email the club,
                        which can become complicated as clients often don't know exactly what information they need to
                        provide. By utilizing a form, both Taiko and potential event organizers can receive the
                        information needed to book Taiko for events.
                        Another application of our website would allow users to find information about upcoming workshops,
                        events, and performances, primarily through a feed and embedded Google Calendar of events. All of
                        Taiko Kai's contact information and social media will be available for anyone else that feels the
                        need to contact the club.
                    </p>
                    <h4>User Accounts & Data Storage</h4>
                    <p class="w3-justify w3-margin-bottom">
                        A second possible application would be a personal portal for users. Users would be able to create
                        an account with their email to organize their information. The general public would be able to view
                        the performances they booked or plan to attend, as well as opt into a quarterly newsletter/email
                        update. Members would be able to access club related files such as meeting notes, attendance,
                        performances documents, practice videos, sheet music, etc. Club officers would have more additional
                        administrative rights as an admin account. They would be able to manage members, edit/organize
                        files,
                        and make changes to website elements. All users would have access towards performance videos and
                        basic Taiko documentation.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cultural Education</h4>
                    <p class="w3-justify w3-margin-bottom">
                        UW Taiko Kai also aims to educate the general public about UW Taiko and its roots. Thus, a section
                        of
                        the webpage will be dedicated to the history of Taiko and UW Taiko Kai. This includes the history
                        and cultural significance of Taiko as a musical instrument in Japan, as well as how the performance
                        art spread to the United States. It will also talk about the history of UW Taiko Kai as an RSO, its
                        development, and its current status at UW.
